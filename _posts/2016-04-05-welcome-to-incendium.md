Want to come to Incendium, here's a quick peek at all of our attractions! 

## Be Our Guest

Here at Incendium City, we have loads to do.  Come visit our Fluffy Bunny Slipper factory, travel the River of Blood (or the River of Lava, we don't judge!), or come to the tongue museum and make your contribution!

Come ride along with the Flying Dutchman as you exolore the city.  See our Boiling Blood Hot Springs and relax a while, and when you have to go home, you'll never want to leave!
